First off, we passed out last night without packing our gear, and thus we were left with that task this morning... big mistake! It was my intention to be out of the hotel by 9am, but we didn't check out til approximately 11:30am. It turns out that packing took much longer than expected (almost 5 hrs).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px 0;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"can bike trip 006\"\n        title=\"can bike trip 006\"\n        src=\"/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/4b190/can_bike_trip_006.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/e07e9/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 200w,\n/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/066f9/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 400w,\n/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/4b190/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 800w,\n/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/e5166/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 1200w,\n/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/ac99c/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 1536w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Once we finally got on the road it was drizzling rain for the first few hours, and we struggled to find our way around the Vancouver bike trails. Luckily there were several friendly people that witnessed our confusion and offered their assistance, which was great! With the help of these friendly souls we were able to get through Vancouver and saw many nice places along the way (unlike yesterday). We then peddled our way through Burnaby, following the bike route that continued from the Vancouver trail.</p>\n<p>However, once the bike trails ended, we were lost! We were extremely unequipped for navigating the suburbs of the GVA, and thus we found ourselves stopping constantly to consult the map. Unfortunately, with only a provincial map, there were several instances where it was impossible to determine our exact location, and as a result we ended up making several wrong turns and detours.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px 0;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"can bike trip 006\"\n        title=\"can bike trip 006\"\n        src=\"/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/4b190/can_bike_trip_006.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/e07e9/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 200w,\n/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/066f9/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 400w,\n/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/4b190/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 800w,\n/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/e5166/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 1200w,\n/static/23e27173982cc00dca3cd48182fc2450/ac99c/can_bike_trip_006.jpg 1536w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Perhaps the worst mistake was missing a turn-off and thus heading up some severe hills towards Simon Fraser University, which appears to be in the middle of nowhere! This cost us valuable time and energy, but it was the last big mistake we made.</p>\n<p>By the time we reached Maple Ridge, we had been riding for approximately 5.5 hrs and it was almost 5pm. Unfortunately we were still almost 40km from Mission, which was our destination for the day. Luckily, we reached the highway and we were able to make good time for the first time all day.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px 0;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"can bike trip 015\"\n        title=\"can bike trip 015\"\n        src=\"/static/fc0e688aa24d5313721643e1e20b3fe3/4b190/can_bike_trip_015.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fc0e688aa24d5313721643e1e20b3fe3/e07e9/can_bike_trip_015.jpg 200w,\n/static/fc0e688aa24d5313721643e1e20b3fe3/066f9/can_bike_trip_015.jpg 400w,\n/static/fc0e688aa24d5313721643e1e20b3fe3/4b190/can_bike_trip_015.jpg 800w,\n/static/fc0e688aa24d5313721643e1e20b3fe3/e5166/can_bike_trip_015.jpg 1200w,\n/static/fc0e688aa24d5313721643e1e20b3fe3/ac99c/can_bike_trip_015.jpg 1536w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>After all the delays and wrong turns, we finally reached Mission at around 9pm, which was much later than anticipated. As a result of all the days hardships we decided to suck it up and book into a hotel for one more night.</p>\n<p>So now I am lying in a comfy (expensive) bed about to settle down for a good night sleep. This is expected to be the last \"real\" bed I will see for a few days (or weeks) and I intend to enjoy it.
