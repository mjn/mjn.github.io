We proceeded with the usual ritual of cooking breakfast, although we had no beans, which wasn't good because a breakfast of oatmeal and a Nature Valley bar is not enough to satisfy my appetite. However, we were forced to make due, and by the time we had finished cleaning and packing, the sun had come out and burned off the overcast sky.</p>\n<p>After riding for a mere 50km or so, I could feel the hunger pains coming on, and this was after we had already stopped for a small snack along the road. I fought the pain, but just as we were starting what appeared to be a nasty climb, I was forced to stop for a quick bite. Dave and I shared a granola bar, and then I was ready to travel the last few kilometres to Montreal River, which was where we were stopping for lunch.</p>\n<p>We had been warned about the hills going into and out of Montreal River for quite sometime now, so I was prepared for the worst. However, what we ended up facing was not too devastating at all... not to say they weren't challenging climbs, but I had built these things up in my mind to be real monsters, and all I got were a few molehills. Well, maybe not that small, but you get the point!</p>\n<p>When we finally got to the restaurant I was ready to eat a horse, so we ordered the biggest meal on the menu, and after inhaling my meal, I finished up with a piece of pie and ice cream. We then set out for Pancake Bay with a full stomach and full of energy.</p>\n<p>The 40km or so to Pancake Bay went extremely fast as there were only a few hills to contend with as we left Montreal River. Once we got past the hills and got close to the Lake Superior shoreline, the terrain became much flatter, allowing us to make great time in getting to our destination. The only real event was when a dog came barrelling down a hill and started chasing Dave, forcing him to haul ass in order to avoid being bitten.</p>\n<p>Once we set up camp and were eating supper, I looked at my bike and noticed that my back tire had almost worn a hole right through. This really concerned be as I am just hoping that it will get me to Sault Ste. Marie tomorrow, which is about 50km away. There I should be able to find a replacement tire at a bike shop, but if it doesn't make it, we could be in for some serious trouble. Luckily, we are close enough to a major city that we should be ok...</p>\n<p>So, tomorrow we will finally reach Sault Ste. Marie and pretty much be done with Northern Ontario... at last! Only three more riding days til we get to Sudbury, which I am really looking forward to as well. It will be nice to relax for a few days since we have been going steady since Winnipeg - the rest day in Upsala doesn't count since it had more of a negative impact than a positive one.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Goin' to the Soo","description":"","mapSrc":"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2722.6104470141013!2d-84.6892954843188!3d46.96934337914758!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4d4823cf366530e3%3A0xd9cdc93bbfc6d5e2!2sPancake%20Bay%20Provincial%20Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1609176232861!5m2!1sen!2sca","date":"Jun 6, 2003"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2003/06/goin-to-the-soo/","next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2003/06/riding-in-the-rain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Riding in the Rain"}},"prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2003/06/back-in-gear/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Back in Gear"}}}},
