It took a while to get back to sleep after that, but once I did, I was able to make it through the rest of the night. I once again awoke refreshed and rearing to go, until I stepped out of the tent and was swarmed by black flies. As a result, we rushed to get all of our gear packed and decided to eat breakfast at Robins Donuts in order to get out of the fly infested campsite as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px 0;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"can bike trip 198\"\n        title=\"can bike trip 198\"\n        src=\"/static/ed0581bdaba23e340645e814eea19bb1/4b190/can_bike_trip_198.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ed0581bdaba23e340645e814eea19bb1/e07e9/can_bike_trip_198.jpg 200w,\n/static/ed0581bdaba23e340645e814eea19bb1/066f9/can_bike_trip_198.jpg 400w,\n/static/ed0581bdaba23e340645e814eea19bb1/4b190/can_bike_trip_198.jpg 800w,\n/static/ed0581bdaba23e340645e814eea19bb1/e5166/can_bike_trip_198.jpg 1200w,\n/static/ed0581bdaba23e340645e814eea19bb1/b17f8/can_bike_trip_198.jpg 1600w,\n/static/ed0581bdaba23e340645e814eea19bb1/d9c39/can_bike_trip_198.jpg 1800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>After breakfast, we hopped on the bikes and headed towards Terrace Bay. As we approached the town, we saw a sign for Agnashore Scenic Lookout and decided to stop and check it out as we had a relatively short trip planned for the day. As we headed towards the lookout we met up with two sisters who were also riding across the country. They had started in B.C. on May 1st and were planning on being in Halifax by July 1st, which was going to be the end of their trip. Once we had finished talking to the one sister (the other had continued riding), we proceeded to the lookout and stopped for a few pictures. We then mounted the bikes again and returned to the highway.</p>\n<p>We managed to catch up to the sisters within about 15km and decided to just ride along with them for a while. They were riding for an organization fighting against pregnancy diseases, and thus had a support vehicle that was transporting all of their gear and following behind them on the road. It turned out that the girls were travelling at a much slower pace than we used to, so when they stopped for lunch, we wished them luck and said goodbye as we continued on.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px 0;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 150%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"can bike trip 199\"\n        title=\"can bike trip 199\"\n        src=\"/static/a733073aca72f1cd6b736b8f5c8f2b4b/4b190/can_bike_trip_199.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a733073aca72f1cd6b736b8f5c8f2b4b/e07e9/can_bike_trip_199.jpg 200w,\n/static/a733073aca72f1cd6b736b8f5c8f2b4b/066f9/can_bike_trip_199.jpg 400w,\n/static/a733073aca72f1cd6b736b8f5c8f2b4b/4b190/can_bike_trip_199.jpg 800w,\n/static/a733073aca72f1cd6b736b8f5c8f2b4b/e5166/can_bike_trip_199.jpg 1200w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Although the trek from Schreiber to Marathon did not consist of many hills of the magnitude of those encountered yesterday while going to Rossport, there were plenty of hills to be climbed. It seemed that there wasn't a flat stretch at all on the entire journey as we were always either going up or down. By the time we reached Marathon we were both starving, so we pulled into the first restaurant we saw for lunch. After lunch we headed into Marathon, which is several kilometres off the highway. We were needing to resupply our food stock, so we headed to the grocery store to pick up the necessities such as oatmeal, granola bars and energy bars.</p>\n<p>When I emerged from the grocery store, Dave asked me to look at the bikes and try to find what was missing. A quick glance was all that was needed to see that Dave had no more water bottles. It turns out that in our hurry to escape the flies, Dave had forgotten to pick up his two water bottles after I had filled them. Thus, we had to head to Canadian Tire to get two new water bottles for Dave, and I picked up a container of lighter fluid for my Zippo lighter.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px 0;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"can bike trip 204\"\n        title=\"can bike trip 204\"\n        src=\"/static/3fea02741cdfc098615067fe90609528/4b190/can_bike_trip_204.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3fea02741cdfc098615067fe90609528/e07e9/can_bike_trip_204.jpg 200w,\n/static/3fea02741cdfc098615067fe90609528/066f9/can_bike_trip_204.jpg 400w,\n/static/3fea02741cdfc098615067fe90609528/4b190/can_bike_trip_204.jpg 800w,\n/static/3fea02741cdfc098615067fe90609528/e5166/can_bike_trip_204.jpg 1200w,\n/static/3fea02741cdfc098615067fe90609528/b17f8/can_bike_trip_204.jpg 1600w,\n/static/3fea02741cdfc098615067fe90609528/d9c39/can_bike_trip_204.jpg 1800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Finally, we headed to the campground to set up camp for the night. We had a supper consisting of boiled hot dogs on a bun... with nothing else, and now we have settled into the tent for the night since we have nothing else to do. Tomorrow is another short day as we will be travelling less than 100km to White River. Thankfully, we are supposedly past the worst of the hills until we reach Wawa, so that's a good thing!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Other Couple","description":"","mapSrc":"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d84187.1844783434!2d-86.4407686242178!3d48.746571328315!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4d438406564ae58b%3A0x22f18fe8b803e455!2sMarathon%2C%20ON!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1609175601592!5m2!1sen!2sca","date":"Jun 3, 2003"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2003/06/the-other-couple/","next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2003/06/24-hours-i-would-like-to-forget/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"24 Hours I Would Like to Forget"}},"prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2003/06/bear-ware-wildlife-abound/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bear-ware!
