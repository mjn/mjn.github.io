<p>We managed to make it through last night without any bear sightings, and the trap was still open signalling no bear activity in the area. There was a light shower early in the morning, but by the time we rolled out of bed, things had mostly dried up making packing away the gear a much easier routine. Once everything was loaded onto the bikes, we headed out for breakfast and then a quick stop at the Pro Hardware was all that was required to reload our propane supply.</p>

<p>We finally got on the road around 10am, and right off I was not feeling up for the days ride. I don't know if it was the cloud cover that loomed overhead, threatening showers for later on, or if I was just lonely, but for whatever reason, I was feeling down in the dumps all morning. I had told Dave earlier at breakfast that I just wanted to be done with northern Ontario. Unfortunately, we still have over 1,000 km until that dream becomes reality.</p>
<p>Anyways, I managed to move on through the nothingness that is northern Ontario, and finally after about 55km of no sign of life, we reached a small restaurant/motel/campground where we stopped for a snack and washroom break. After that we got back on the road, and within 15 minutes the clouds became darker and loomed much larger in the sky.</p>

<p>I decided to pick up the pace as we were still on the edge of the cloud cover, and all I hoped was that we would get to Upsala before any serious rain started falling. Luckily, we reached Upsala having put up with only a few drops of rain and we were able to get the tent set up without any hassle.</p>
<p>Just before we went to grab a shower, we got all of our gear ready and under the tent in the case that it started raining while we were away. We also put all of our food in a bag and placed it under the table in order not to lead wildlife to the tent. To my surprise, when I returned to the tent after my shower, I saw a crow on the picnic table. I shooed him away and then noticed that the food bag had been torn apart with a Vector bar lying open on the ground. Close inspection revealed that all of our MEC meals had at least been torn into, requiring duct tape to close the holes, and several packs of oatmeal had been opened as well. We cursed the animals that had done this and then decided to put the food bag in the bathroom for the night.</p>

<p>We then went for dinner at the nearby restaurant, and here we are again, cooped up in the tent early in the evening trying to avoid the rain. There are threats of a thunderstorm once again, and there is a possibility that we will be waking up to rain in the morning. I think it is all the showers and threats of rain that is having such a negative impact on me. Whatever, it is, I hope that it goes away soon.</p>
