  <p>The goal for today was to simply make it from Steelhead Provincial Park to Kamloops, which was a mere 45km away. Therefore, we slept in a bit which was a great relief to me since I had trouble sleeping due to the windy conditions during the night. Once we had awoken and started packing all the gear up, I noticed that there was a lot of construction ongoing and people were moving all about. I thought nothing of it at first, but it turned out that the people were building a set for an upcoming Jennifer Lopez and Robert Redford movie called &quot;An Unfinished Life&quot;, which was pretty cool!</p>

<p>Once we set out, we were immediately faced with a steep hill, and it seemed that most of the trip to Kamloops was uphill, but since it was a short trip it wasn't a big deal. The highlight of the trip was when we were riding past a house located just off the highway; as I approached, a dog came flying up the hill after me, and I quickly changed gears in order to outrace the dog. However, as Dave came riding behind me the dog picked up the chase on Dave, forcing him to pull out into the middle of the road to avoid the dog... thankfully there were no cars on the road at the time! Aside from that, the trip was rather uneventful.</p>

<p>Once we reached Kamloops we made our way to the Canadian Tire to reload on bike tubes (as a result of yesterdays troubles). We then checked into a cheap motel (or &quot;tel&quot; if you read the flashing sign at night, which is a classic sign of a seedy joint!). We then set out in search of Internet access to our overflowing (yeah right!) email and fire off a few emails of our own.</p>

<p>That's pretty much it for now... our plans for the next couple of days are to go to Salmon Arm followed by Revelstoke, Golden and then Banff. Finally, we should reach Calgary in about five days. That area is still experiencing crazy weather, but hopefully things will settle down before we get there...</p>
