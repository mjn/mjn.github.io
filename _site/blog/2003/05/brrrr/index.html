  <p>I guess it was bound to happen... what with all the crazy weather that Alberta has been having recently and the sheer altitude we are currently at... anyway, today we were forced to bike through snow! It looked like it was going to be a beautiful day when we left Field with the sun peaking over the mountain tops. It was a bit chilly, but I certainly did not expect it to get as cold as it did.</p>
<p>I should have realized we would be in for a frigid day when we were forced to climb a rather steep hill, taking us once again high into the mountains. We were riding through Kicking Horse Pass, and if we thought Rogers Pass was bad, we hadn't seen anything yet! By the time we reached the top, we had reached an elevation of about 1650m, almost 300m higher than Rogers Pass!</p>

<p>That would turn out to be the end of the major climbing for the day though, thank God! Actually, it may have been our last major climb of the entire trip (<em>knock on wood</em>).</p>
<p>The next major event was when we reached the British Columbia - Alberta border. This marked the completion of the first province, and it brought with it a great sense of satisfaction. Now with the first province in the books, we turn our sights on the remaining nine...</p>
<p>Following a few pictures at the border, we continued onto Lake Louise where we stopped for a quick snack and then headed towards Banff. As the Trans Canada became a major highway at this junction, we opted to travel to Banff via the Bow Valley Parkway. Just minutes after riding down this road, I began to question the decision... the road was a very narrow stretch of highway that was all but empty, spare the odd car that passed by. Although this made for great riding conditions, it worried the hell out of me for fear of an increased possibility of encountering dangerous wildlife (spelled "bears"!). Right away we saw several elk just off the side of the highway, which certainly didn't help the nerves. As a result of this threat, Dave and I decided that we would travel to Banff without stopping to eat at all. In the end, all went ok and we were able to make good time in getting to a Banff as a result of the ideal conditions (aside from the snow and cold).</p>

<p>Once in Banff we checked into the Global Village Backpackers hostel, which turned out to be a rather large, busy establishment. We are roomed with a group of four other people that are actually driving across the country (at least most of the country). After getting settled in our room, we headed out in search of food. Dave was amazed at how commercial this town is, and he couldn't believe how ritzy everything looked. I too was taken aback by the resort mentality of the place, and I have even been here before!</p>
<p>So now that we have finally arrived in Banff, we set our sights on Calgary. We are really looking forward to heading down the mountains and not having to worry about climbing hills for days on end... although I'm sure that each other region of the country will offer it's own challenge.</p>
<p>Now that I have completed the first province, I guess it would be worth it to take some time to reflect upon what we have accomplished thus far...</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="can_bike_trip_070-400w.webp 400w, can_bike_trip_070-800w.webp 800w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"><img src="can_bike_trip_070-400w.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" srcset="can_bike_trip_070-400w.jpeg 400w, can_bike_trip_070-800w.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"></picture></p>
<p>Mentally, I couldn't be better right now... I admit that there have more than a few instances where I have wondered if this trip is actually worth the hassle and effort. However, whenever these cases have arisen, I have been able to overcome them by either listening to music (Metallica always soothes the savage beast!) or calling my parents. It has been their support that has actually provided the greatest motivation to see this through to completion. Also, now that I have (pretty much) conquered the Rockies and British Columbia, I feel I can overcome anything this country has to offer. I'm sure that there will be other times where spirits are low, but I am also sure that I will be able to overcome those tough times. I am sure that doing this trip will pay off big time in the long run.</p>
<p>Physically, I feel great right now. I think I am quickly getting into the greatest shape of my life, and I have the Rockies to thank for it. Hill climbing no longer bothers me, and I believe that I have the strength to deal with any physical challenge encountered.</p>
<p>All considering, I feel great right now and I am sure that as the trip continues things can only get better.</p>
