  <p>Well after three great days staying with my dad in Winnipeg, it was time to get back on the road. The time spent in Winnipeg was very relaxing, with Dave and I sitting around and doing nothing for the first couple of days. Yesterday, dad took us downtown so that we could see Portage and Main, Canada's windiest intersection (it was actually quite calm!). We also went to The Forks, which is where the Assiniboine and Red River meet.</p>

<p>We then returned home for a delicious steak dinner with my cousin Paul. It was great to see Paul again as we had become pretty close while he was living in Ottawa. It was truly an enjoyable evening with a good time had by all.</p>
<p>This morning I woke up with mixed emotions as I was looking forward to getting back on the bike and continuing the trip, but I didn't want to have to say goodbye to dad. It just felt that the few days that we spent together went by too quickly, as is always the case. As a result, it was much harder leaving than I expected. However, we had to get back on the road, so I bid farewell to dad, knowing that I would see him in less than a month at my convocation.</p>

<p>The biking today was really good as we had a gorgeous day with the sun beating down and temperatures getting into the mid-twenties. The only complaint is that it took a while to get the body back in gear (especially the butt!), and there was a slight head wind at times which made riding a bit tougher. All considering though, it was a great day and we covered over 150km again.</p>

<p>We are now in Falcon Lake, which is located inside Whiteshell Provincial Park, and we are about 20km from the Ontario border. Tomorrow morning we will be entering Ontario, and thus we will have completed our fourth province in Manitoba. It's crazy how fast the prairies went, but we will be coming back into reality now as we won't be entering a new province until mid-July... ok, so it's mainly because we are taking several weeks off, but still! I am looking forward to the challenge of Ontario though... it's nice to see thick forests again as well as hills, but I am sure I will be cursing the hills again before too long!</p>
