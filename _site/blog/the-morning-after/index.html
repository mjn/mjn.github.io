  <p>We woke up following a night of off and on sleep due to the thunderstorm and persistent rain ready to head to the Saskatchewan capital. The ground was all muddy and things were still damp, but luckily our gear all managed to stay dry under the tarp of our trusty tent. We quickly packed up all the gear, had a small breakfast and hopped on our bikes (after cleaning the mud off our shoes and bikes).</p>

<p>We were scared at first that we would be riding into a fierce head wind, but as we headed eastward, the wind was at our backs and pushing us along. As a result, we covered the 75km to Regina in just over 2 hours. We then set about finding a cheap place to stay for our time in Regina.</p>
<p>Luckily, Dave saw a sign along the highway for a motel with rooms for $42 and up, and it seemed to be in a downtown location. Well, after we cycled around much of the Regina downtown area, we finally found our destination - Coachman Inn Motel. It wasn't exactly downtown, but it was within walking distance. We checked in and then headed to our room. I knew we were in trouble when Dave emerged from the office with not only the room key, but also the TV remote control - definitely the sign of a classy joint! A quick scan of the room confirmed our worst fears... oh well, it is merely a place to lay our heads for a couple of nights.</p>

<p>We relaxed for the rest of the day following a quick trip downtown for a bite to eat at Izzy Magoo's Diner. We both grabbed an order of chilli cheese fires that worked through our system quicker than any laxative could ever do... including McDonalds!</p>
<p>We took advantage of having a television by watching the Anaheim Mighty Ducks eliminate the Minnesota Wild to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. I then passed out for the night and slept soundly for the first time in a few nights.</p>
