I have spent the past 7+ years of my career working as a Growth Engineer* at two of the largest and most successful companies in their respective industries - first at Tripadvisor, and now at Shopify. Over that time, the questions I get the most frequently are:

-  What is a growth engineer?
-  What do you do?

Admitedly, in the moment, I typically have a hard time explaining exactly what it is that I do - and that's because being a growth engineer typically involves doing a lot of things, and more specifically, it involves doing a lot of *different* things.

## What a growth engineer is not

Before I try to explain what a growth engineer *is*, let me start by saying what a growth engineer *is not*. Many people associate *growth* with *marketing*, and there are many people in the software industry that consider development positions within the marketing organization of a company to be a role for more junior developers, and that the role doesn't require solving *hard problems*.

However, this couldn't be further from the truth - at least not the way that growth engineering is done at Tripadvisor and Shopify.

## So, what is a growth engineer?

In my experience, a growth engineer is a well rounded, full stack developer that also posesses strong data and analytical skills, and is interested in experimenting to find new ways to get customers further down the acquisition funnel.

That is a mouthful, so I will offer an example from my own personal experience to try and better illustrate what a growth engineer does. While working at Tripadvisor, I did the following:

- Devised, executed and analyzed an experiment that increased organic traffic to our restaurant listing pages by 20%
- Worked on the tool that was used to run and measure experiments
- Built the pipeline for the data source that drove the experiment measurement tool

As can be clearly seen by the above example, a growth engineer must posess many different skills in order to be successful in driving growth.

## What do I do?

Since joining Shopify last year, I have been primarily focused on building internal tools that:

- provide insights into how Shopify is performing versus competitors;
- increase the number of experiments that may be run simultaneously, allowing for more ideas to be tested more quickly; and 
- assist others in being more efficient in their day to day jobs so that they can be even more focused on driving growth.

While Shopify has seen tremendous growth over the past couple of years - particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, where many brick and mortar retailers were forced to take their business online in order to survive - there is still plenty of room to grow, and that's why I am so excited by the work that I am currently doing.

* Yes, I know that technically I'm not supposed to use the title "Engineer" unless I am a certified Professional Engineer, but the term Growth Developer doesn't have the same ring to it, and I'm not a fan of the term Growth Hacker... so, Growth Engineer is what I'm going with!
