Well I could pretty much write this journal entry by the light of the lightning that we are currently in the middle of. Things went great for the entire bike ride, aside from a few anxious moments where it looked like it might rain. We once again elapsed the (Imperial) century mark (160 km) as we made our way from Swift Current to Moose Jaw.

It was once we reached Moose Jaw that things got interesting... we first went for supper at Robins Donuts, and as we cycled through the city we could see lightning in the distance. As we ate it appeared that the storm had passed and thus we hopped on the bikes in search of the campground. A quick check of the sky revealed that the storm was just getting revved up!

We started riding and got maybe a kilometre before rain started falling again. Thus, we pulled into the Wal-Mart and waited out the brief shower. We then proceeded to the campground and set up the tent as quickly as possible. Not even 15 minutes after the tent was up did it start raining again. We piled everything under the tarp of the tent and got inside before everything was drenched.

And so we have been in the tent ever since with the rain falling off and on. However, the thunder and lightning has been almost non-stop for the past two hours. For the most part it has been in the distance, but several times it has passed directly overhead and with it comes the driving rain.

Now it is no secret that I am not a fan of lightning... I would much prefer to be huddled up in a house (or building of some sort) during a thunderstorm. Unfortunately, I am lying here in a tiny tent just praying to get through the night. Somehow Dave is managing to sleep through the storm while I have been tossing and turning and sweating up a storm, due in part to my nervousness as well as the intense humidity and stuffiness in the tent.

All I can hope for is to get some sleep tonight so that I will be ready to bike to Regina tomorrow, where thankfully we will be in a motel! Luckily it's a short trip to Regina and we will be taking a rest day so hopefully the sun will be back on Sunday - wouldn't that be appropriate!

Well that's it for now... I guess I will return to watching the constant flashing of lightning and counting to see how far away the storm is... not much else I can do since it doesn't appear that sleep is an option right now!
