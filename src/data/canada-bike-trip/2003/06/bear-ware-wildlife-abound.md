Last night I managed to have the best sleep in the tent that I have had thus far on the trip. I woke up just once he entire night, and at that point I couldn't believe I was in the tent - it felt like I was back home in my own bed! As a result, I was completely refreshed this morning, and I was eager to get on the road. After the morning ritual of cooking, cleaning and packing, we left Dorion with the sun shining down on us.

Unfortunately, my body must have wanted to stay in bed as it simply wasn't co-operating with regards to riding. I felt hungry after only 30 minutes of riding, and I couldn't wait to get to Nipigon, which was a measly 35km away. When we reached Nipigon, we had a few things to take care of at the travel info booth and Canadian Tire. Then, it was off to Subway for lunch to try and get my body back in gear. Following a filling lunch, I was feeling much better, and we set out for what should have been an enjoyable, though difficult, afternoon ride.

We had been warned that the stretch into Rossport and up to Terrace Bay had hills that rivalled those in the Rockies, and they didn't disappoint. After several climbs that were the biggest we had seen in a while, we passed a sign saying 20km to Rossport and were greeted by a hill that seemed to go on forever. So we started the ascent and managed to get maybe a kilometre before a truck coming in the opposite direction started flashing his lights, honking his horn and waving. I figured he was just cheering us on, so I politely waved and continued onwards. I got around the bend and then it happened!

Just ahead of me I could see the back of a large, black animal in the ditch on the other side of the road. My worst fear was coming true as we had encountered a black bear along the highway! I slowly continued to ride on, hoping the bear would be startled and run away. Instead, the bear wandered onto the highway and I stopped dead in my tracks. I looked around and saw that if the bear was going to cross the highway, he would have to go around a guardrail that extended all the way down to where I was standing; thus, I turned around and slowly rode back to where Dave was, and we simply waited to see what would develop. Luckily, a truck happened to drive by which drove the bear off the highway, and as the driver honked the horn, the bear ran into the trees. We were free to continue!

We continued to ride, and merely two kilometres further up the hill, we heard a branch snap in the trees immediately to our left. I looked over but saw nothing, so I kept on pedalling. Then, I heard Dave screaming: "Did you see that?!?". Now my heart was really pumping! Fortunately, it was only a moose, and it had stayed out of our way.

We continued riding, and as we passed Pays Plat First Nations community, I once again saw the back of what looked like an animal. I stopped the bike and asked Dave what he thought it was, but he couldn't see what I was looking at. A car then drove by and the animal lifted its head... luckily it was another moose, and it started walking towards the trees. We pedalled on slowly, and as we approached the moose it ran into the trees. It seems that moose are much more afraid of the bikes.

After all of this, I was on edge and second guessing the entire trip! Also, my body had started aching again and all I wanted was to be in a bed as far away from Northern Ontario as I possibly could be. However, I pressed on and we managed to get to Schreiber without encountering anymore wildlife.

Following a dinner of soup and a sandwich, we headed to the nearest campground and set up camp. I must admit, I seriously considered getting a motel room, but I am trying to put the bear encounter behind me and get on with the journey. All the same, I really can't wait to get out of Northern Ontario. This part of the country has not been nice to me at all!
